Knowdex is a local-first, structurally consistent collaborative knowledge graph. It relies on advanced Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to guarantee high-fidelity data synchronization and deterministic conflict resolution across an arbitrarily large network of edge clients.

## Architectural Topology

The backend topology separates long-lived, stateful connections from stateless HTTP requests, ensuring that resource-intensive WebSocket broadcasts do not degrade standard API performance.

```

## Conflict-Free Replicated Data Protocol (CRDT)

At the core of the collaboration engine lies the `Y.js` protocol. When concurrent updates occur across isolated network partitions, the CRDT algorithm guarantees that all peers mathematically converge on the identical final document state.

### Multi-Node Synchronization Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C1 as Client 1 (Edge)
    participant N1 as WS Gateway Alpha
    participant MessageBus as Redis Backbone
    participant N2 as WS Gateway Beta
    participant C2 as Client 2 (Edge)

    Note over C1,C2: Both clients possess Document Version V1
    C1->>C1: User types "Hello"
    C1->>N1: Transmit Uint8Array Update (V2)
    N1->>MessageBus: Publish Topic [DocID] -> V2
    MessageBus->>N2: Distribute to Subscriber
    N2->>C2: Dispatch binary frame (V2)
    C2->>C2: Apply fractional update (Y.applyUpdate)
    Note over C1,C2: Guaranteed state convergence without operational transformation (OT)
```

## Component Architecture

Knowdex is orchestrated as a Turborepo monorepo, delineating rigid boundaries between generic utilities and domain-specific microservices.

### Module Specifications

- **`@repo/crdt`**: Defines the proprietary binary codecs utilized for data transport between clients and the WebSocket gateway, preventing parsing overhead associated with JSON payloads.
- **`@repo/db`**: Manages the unified PostgreSQL schema via Prisma. Enforces foreign key constraints and referential integrity across the system.
- **`apps/ws-backend`**: A scalable, non-blocking Node.js process dedicated exclusively to multiplexing WebSocket streams and coordinating the Y.js state vector.
- **`apps/http-backend`**: A traditional stateless REST API managing authentication boundaries, role-based access control, and metadata querying.

## System Prerequisites

To deploy or build the Knowdex ecosystem, the following host environments must be provisioned:

- Container Orchestrator: Docker Engine 24.0+
- Orchestration Tool: Docker Compose v2.20+
- Runtime: Node.js 20.x LTS
- Package Manager: pnpm 9.0+

## Local Deployment

1. **Environment Configuration**
   Provision the environment variables required for cryptographic signing and external integrations.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Containerized Provisioning**
   Initialize the complete stack via Docker Compose. This strategy ensures parity with production topology.

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

3. **Service Verification**
   Verify all subsystems are operational and responding to health checks.
   - Application Gateway: http://localhost:3000
   - REST Services: http://localhost:8000/health
   - WebSocket Services: http://localhost:8080/health

## Continuous Delivery Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline enforces rigorous static analysis prior to image generation.

```mermaid

    Push[Code Push] --> Typecheck[TSC Matrix]

    Push --> Test[Jest Suites]

    Typecheck --> Build[Docker Build]
    Lint --> Build
    Test --> Build

    Build --> Deploy[Rolling Update]
```

Production environments utilize independently deployed artifacts, allowing the WebSocket nodes to scale autonomously from the HTTP cluster in response to high concurrency scenarios.
